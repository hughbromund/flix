### Notes

The tutorial video appears to use an older version of iOS. In the current iOS, when adding a grid cell prototype, a Content View is placed inside of it by default. This caused me many problems because the contnet view wanted to pad the sides of the image I was trying to show. Eventually, I had to use autolayout to simply override the padding that was being added.
